# Simon-Project

In this repository, I'm going to be going over my process of trying to replicate the game Simon on a Raspberry Pi.  The result was mostly successful, with a little bit of jank.

The version I ended up with only uses two lights and buttons instead of the traditional four in order to keep things simple.  Just like the acutal game, one light will flash.  If the user presses the correct button, the same light will flash and then the sequence will be extended, either by the same light or by the other light at random.  This will continue until the user is incorrect and a score will be printed on the screen.

The required components are:

1. Raspberry Pi
2. Breadboard
3. Four male-to-male jumper cables
4. Five male-to-female jumper cables
5. Two LED lights of different colors
6. Two push button switches
